## Want to Help?
CWCO welcomes suggestions and improvements done under following guidelines:

1. Create issues for tracking, no matter how small is the fix or suggestion;
2. If you can, submit PR after you have the issue created. All contributions PR must have a matching issue explaining the problem no matter how small it is;
3. Use the `develop` branch to create your PRs. That branch will always have the current and future stuff.
3. Questions and discussions should happen in the [discussion page](https://github.com/beforesemicolon/cwco/discussions) or comments in [wiki](https://github.com/beforesemicolon/cwco/wiki).
